In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is placeholder text (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout, by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin.
Even though "lorem ipsum" may arouse curiosity because of its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. If text is comprehensible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation. Therefore publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design elements and page layout in order to direct the focus to the publication style and not the meaning of the text. In spite of its basis in Latin, the use of lorem ipsum is often referred to as greeking, from the phrase "it's all Greek to me", which indicates that something is not meant to be readable text, although greeking has other meanings as well.
A common form of lorem ipsum text reads as follows:
Another version of the text uses the word "adipisici" (rather than "adipiscing"; the digraph ng at the end of words is alien to classical Latin). Other versions of lorem ipsum include additional words to add variety so that repeated verses will not word-wrap on the same phrases.
A variation of the common lorem ipsum text has been used since the 1960s or earlier to provide a filler text during typesetting.
The text is derived from sections 1.10.32–3 of Cicero'sDe finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Boundaries of Goods and Evils, or alternatively [About] The Purposes of Good and Evil). The original passage began: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves pain itself since it is pain and thus wants to obtain it"). It is not known exactly when the text acquired its current standard form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. The source of the passage was discovered before 1982 by Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar who was the publications director at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, discovered the source of the passage sometime before 1982 while searching for citings of the Latin word "consectetur", rarely used in classical literature. The physical source of the Lorem Ipsum text may be the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the De Finibus, where the Latin text finishes page 134 with "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and begins page 136 with "lorem ipsum (et seq.) ...," suggesting that the galley type of that page was scrambled to make the dummy text seen today. This suggests that "lorem ipsum" may have been used as dummy text before the Letraset transfer sheets popularized it.
The original version (with the excerpted items highlighted) appears in Book 1, sections 32–3 (pagination varies by publisher):
The text does not have any occurrences of the letters K, or Z (because Latin used primarily in Greek words), nor the letter W (it was not part of the Classical Roman Alphabet).
H. Rackham's 1914 translation - in the aforementioned Loeb Classical Library edition - with the major source of lorem ipsum highlighted:
Cicero's first Oration against Catiline is sometimes used in type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet?…
Today's popular version of lorem ipsum was first created for Aldus Corporation's first desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker in the mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh.Art director Laura Perry adapted older forms of the lorem text from typography samples—it was, for example, widely used in Letraset catalogs in the 1960s and 1970s (anecdotes suggest that the original use of the "Lorem ipsum" text was by Letraset, which was used for print layouts by advertising agencies as early as the 1970s). The text was frequently used in PageMaker templates.
Various pieces of software, including text editors (or plug-in modules for same), can generate semi-random "lorem text" that often has little or nothing in common with the canonical variety, other than looking like (and often being) jumbled Latin. Apple's Pages and Keynote software use this jumbled text as a sample screenplay for their screenplay layout. Lorem ipsum is also featured on Joomla! and WordPress web content managers. Microsoft Office Word 2007 and 2010 have a Lorem ipsum feature. "Lorem and More" is an extension for inserting "lorem text" into web pages in AdobeDreamweaver.
